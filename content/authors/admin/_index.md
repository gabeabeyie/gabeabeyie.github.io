Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

My research focuses on applying machine learning methods to answer a range of macroeconomic questions. I explore how data-driven insights, such as text analysis and machine learning techniques, can enhance our understanding of economic dynamics and market behavior.

In my job market paper, I analyze how OPEC announcements influence oil price changes by combining oil futures data with textual data from news articles. Using text-based features, I capture market expectations and reactions, allowing for a better understanding of the unanticipated changes in oil prices. 

I am on the 2024-25 academic job market.
